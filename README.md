## Instructions:
- First uninstall current realtek audio driver, realtek uwp control panel and other 3rd party enhancement app like nahimic/dts/dolby/creative.
- Restart ur PC with Disable driver signature enforcement:

Go to Settings > Update & Security > Recovery > Advanced startup > click Restart now

Now go to Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings > click Restart

After the restart u will get a Startup Settings page, press F7 to go into disable driver signature enforcement.

- Download driver "***_UAD_WHQL_DTS_2021.7z" from here [![Github all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/shibajee/realtek-uad-dts-mod/total.svg)](https://github.com/shibajee/realtek-uad-dts-mod/releases/) and extract it.

- Go to the extracted folder and double click Setup.exe.

Continue with the warning sign and click Install this driver software anyway. Do not restart, select I will restart my computer later.

Wait a few minutes. DTS HPXv1, DTSX Ultra and Realtek control panel should download and install automatically in background if u have internet.

- Now if u see this 3 app in start menu after like 3~5 minute restart ur PC.

- After restarting ur PC, open those apps. Play a music file and try different presets or settings to ensure that DTS effects r working properly.

- In some situation 1/2 or all 3 app could be missing in start menu. That means they didn't download/install properly in background for some reason. In that case u can download those app from Microsoft store.

Quick shortcut code to download/install the UWP apps from Microsoft store, Windows Key+R and paste then hit enter:

`ms-windows-store://pdp/?PFN=DTSInc.DTSHeadphoneXv1_t5j2fzbtdg37r`

`ms-windows-store://pdp/?PFN=DTSInc.DTSXUltra_t5j2fzbtdg37r`

`ms-windows-store://pdp/?PFN=RealtekSemiconductorCorp.RealtekAudioControl_dt26b99r8h8gj`

- For some reason if u don't have Microsoft store (bcoz u have higher IQ than me) or u have trouble installing from store then just download the "UWP_Offline_BUNDLE.7z" and run "INSTALL_UWP_BUNDLE.bat" as administrator. U probably have to enable developer option before install offline apps.

- Enable Developer option:

Go to Settings > Update & Security > For developers > click to enable Developer Mode *ON* and close the window.
